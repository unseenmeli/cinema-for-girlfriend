# Girlfriend Cinema - Progress Summary

## What We Built
A multiplayer 3D cinema room where you and your girlfriend can watch videos together in first-person view.

## Current Features
- **Multiplayer**: Real-time synchronization using Socket.io
- **First-person controls**: WASD to move, mouse to look, SPACE to jump
- **Interactive sofa**: Press E to sit and watch videos together
- **Video playback**: Synchronized video player (loads videos but display still needs fixing)
- **Collision**: Can't walk through the sofa

## Textures Applied
- **Floor**: `wood-floor.jpg` (2x2 repeat, darkened with 0x888888)
- **Ceiling**: `wood-floor.jpg` (2x2 repeat, darkened with 0x888888)
- **Walls**: `brick-wall.jpg` (3x1 repeat)
- **Sofa**: `fur-texture.jpg` (dark brown tint 0x3d2817)
- **Rug**: `fur-texture.jpg` (1x1 repeat, beige tint 0xd4a574)

## Decorations
- String lights around room perimeter (warm glowing bulbs)
- Hanging vines on walls (green transparent planes)
- Circular rug in front of sofa

## Movement Settings
- Move speed: 100.0
- Jump velocity: 8.0
- Gravity: 20.0
- Friction: 20.0

## Known Issues to Fix
- **Video display not working**: Video loads and plays (audio works) but doesn't show on screen
  - Texture is created and applied but renders black
  - Need to debug Three.js VideoTexture rendering

## How to Run
```bash
cd girlfriend-cinema
npm start
```
Open `http://localhost:3000` in two browsers to test multiplayer.

## Next Steps
1. Fix video texture display on screen
2. Add more decorations if needed
3. Optimize performance if laggy
4. Test multiplayer video sync
